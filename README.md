**A 320B-parameter MoE with a 262,144-token context, served on four CMP 170HX
cards in two layouts. Release 1.8.0 tensor-parallel results with verified peer-to-peer at 74 SMs:
482.6 tok/s for one user and 943.7 tok/s across eight,
3,161 tok/s cold prefill and a 1,203,765-token KV pool. The weights
are W4A16 and nothing else is cut: the KV cache is full precision, there is no
FP8 anywhere, and nothing is offloaded to CPU or disk.**

This repository installs and runs **GLM-5.3-Flash** on **four NVIDIA CMP 170HX
cards** behind an OpenAI-compatible API, with tool calls, reasoning, images and
video, and a **DFlash2** speculative drafter. Upstream vLLM's sparse-attention
path needs a Hopper GPU; the CMP 170HX is Ampere (sm_80). Our
[vLLM fork](https://github.com/Morrowmake/vllm-cmp170hx/tree/ampere) adds
the Ampere kernels that make the model run at all, then spends the rest of its
patches on making it fast and making it repeatable. It runs only as a container
image, so the engine and its Python environment stay out of your system.
P2P is enabled automatically after a startup [content check](docs/how-to-use.md#pcie-peer-to-peer) passes; otherwise the server runs with P2P disabled.

Also on these cards: [DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on four CMP 170HX](https://github.com/Morrowmake/dsv41-flash-cmp170hx-recipe).

## Quick start

One command from a fresh clone, after the [one-time host setup](#one-time-host-setup):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Morrowmake/glm53-flash-cmp170hx-recipe.git
cd glm53-flash-cmp170hx-recipe
./start.sh          # pull the engine image, fetch the model, start, wait for /health
```

Then try it:

```bash
./start.sh smoke    # one chat request and one tool call
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "glm-5.3-flash",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about PCIe."}],
       "max_tokens": 4096}'
```

> **GLM-5.3 always reasons before it answers.** The reasoning comes back in the
> message's `reasoning` field and the answer in `content`. **Set `max_tokens`
> for the reasoning plus the answer:** if the limit is reached while the model
> is still reasoning, `content` comes back empty with `finish_reason: "length"`.
> `"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}` has no effect; use
> `reasoning_effort` (`low`, `high`, `max`) to shorten the reasoning
> ([Talk to it](docs/how-to-use.md#talk-to-it)).

`./start.sh` skips anything already done, so running it twice is safe; an
interrupted download resumes. The image ships no warm-cache seed: it starts
compile on first boot (cold), so the first start is slower; later starts reuse
the compiled kernels in `./cache`.
Any OpenAI-compatible client works with base URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`
and model `glm-5.3-flash`. The API listens on this machine only and has no
API key unless you [change that](docs/how-to-use.md#serving-other-machines).
Python, streaming and tool-call clients are in [examples/](examples/README.md).

**Prefer Docker Compose?** The same container, also one command from a fresh
clone:

```bash
docker compose up              # or in the background: docker compose up -d
```

It downloads the checkpoints, then starts the server as the owner of the
checkout; `docker compose ps` shows it healthy once `/health` answers
([Docker Compose](docs/how-to-use.md#docker-compose)). Compose restarts a
crashed server up to 3 times; `./start.sh` does not (run `./start.sh restart`).
Use one or the other.

Both download the checkpoints at the exact Hugging Face revisions this release
was validated with.

> **Which setups this release is for.** Two layouts, one switch
> (`LAYOUT=tp4` or `LAYOUT=pp4`):
>
> - **Tensor-parallel 4** (the default) is optimised for **PCIe x16 links** —
>   cards with the x16 capacitor modification. It gives each request the
>   fastest answer. On cards limited to x4 links it is bus-bound and much
>   slower.
> - **Pipeline-parallel 4** passes only activations between the cards, so it
>   needs far less link bandwidth; it is the layout **for cards limited to x4
>   links**, and for many parallel users and long prompts. Performance on x4
>   links has not yet been measured.
>
> `./start.sh` checks your link width and suggests `LAYOUT=pp4` if a card is
> narrower than x16.

## One-time host setup

- **4× NVIDIA CMP 170HX, each exposing 64 GiB**; **PCIe Gen2 x16 links** for
  tensor-parallel 4 (pipeline-parallel 4 is built for narrower links)
- Linux with NVIDIA driver **580 or newer**
- Docker with the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html),
  usable by your user: `docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:13.3.1-base-ubuntu24.04 nvidia-smi`
  lists all four cards
- optional: a P2P-capable driver build for verified peer-to-peer
  ([PCIe peer-to-peer](docs/how-to-use.md#pcie-peer-to-peer)); without it the
  server runs with P2P disabled
- for `./start.sh`: `git`, `curl`, `flock`, `setsid`, Python 3 for the boot
  check, and `jq` for the smoke test
- about 180 GiB (193 GB) of disk for the two checkpoints, plus the engine image
  and the kernel compile caches ([details](docs/how-to-use.md#what-you-need))

## Headline numbers

Measured 2026-10-16 on 4× CMP 170HX, 74 SMs per card, mainline cmpunlocker
with P2P, recipe defaults, 262,144-token context, 180 W per card and PCIe x16 links.
Decode uses the MiaAI-Lab protocol: 400 tokens, temperature 0, requests sent with
thinking off (GLM-5.3 reasons regardless; reasoning tokens count); one user is
the median of five runs, and two, four and eight users the median aggregate
rate of three runs, each layout on one boot.

| | Tensor-parallel 4<br>+ [peer-to-peer](docs/how-to-use.md#pcie-peer-to-peer) (default after verification) | Pipeline-parallel 4<br>+ [peer-to-peer](docs/how-to-use.md#pcie-peer-to-peer) |
|---|---:|---:|
| **1 user** · structured | **482.6** | 232.4 |
| **1 user** · code | **442.1** | 209.9 |
| **1 user** · prose | **232.1** | 100.1 |
| **2 users, total** · structured | 606.5 | 343.8 |
| **2 users, total** · code | 460.3 | 273.4 |
| **2 users, total** · prose | 314.7 | 195.5 |
| **4 users, total** · structured | 717.7 | 409.2 |
| **4 users, total** · code | 618.7 | 382.8 |
| **4 users, total** · prose | 501.4 | 314.2 |
| **8 users, total** · structured | **943.7** | 664.1 |
| **8 users, total** · code | **835.0** | 608.8 |
| **8 users, total** · prose | **667.2** | 469.2 |
| **Prompt reading** (cold prefill) | 3,161 | **7,419** |
| **KV pool** (tokens) | 1,203,765 | **2,088,960** |

All rates are up-to figures in tok/s. One user is streaming speed per request; two, four and
eight users are the combined rate of that many simultaneous requests.
Structured output and code are drafted well, so they decode fastest; prose
least. DFlash2 drafts up to 7 tokens ahead for one user and 3 under load.
One-user prose varies most between runs. Both layouts were measured on PCIe x16
links. Quality on the final release build, scored on the answer after the
reasoning: TP4 HumanEval 151/164 and GSM8K 1,286/1,319.
Method and exact figures: [Results](docs/results.md).

## Settings

Settings live in `.env`; see [Settings](docs/how-to-use.md#settings)
for boot checks and default reasoning effort.

## Choosing a layout

Tensor-parallel 4 (`tp4`, the default) gives one or two interactive users the
fastest answer per request and needs x16 links. Pipeline-parallel 4 (`pp4`)
suits many parallel users, long prompts and x4 links, with higher cold prefill
throughput and a larger KV pool ([Results](docs/results.md)). Switch with `LAYOUT=pp4 ./start.sh restart` (or set it
in `.env`); details in [Choosing a layout](docs/results.md#choosing-a-layout).

## Update

- `./start.sh update` pulls the new release and engine image and restarts; your `.env` is preserved.
  A checkout that ran the engine natively under an earlier release moves to the
  container on the same `.env` and checkpoints ([details](docs/how-to-use.md#day-to-day)).
- With Compose: `git pull`, then `docker compose up -d`.
- Older releases are git tags; their images may be retired.

**Updating to 1.8.0 from 1.7.x:**

- **Size `max_tokens` for the reasoning plus the answer.** GLM-5.3 always
  reasons; this engine returns the reasoning in `reasoning` and the answer in
  `content`. A reply that hits the limit while still reasoning has an empty
  `content`. `enable_thinking: false` has no effect.
- In `.env`, delete any `VLLM_BRANCH=ampere-glm53` line (that branch is
  retired), any `IMAGE` or `VLLM_COMMIT` line (to follow this release's image),
  and an `EXTRA_ARGS` line carrying `max_pixels` and `max_image_tokens` if you
  added it for `MM_CAP=1` on 1.7.2.
- Engine switches have new names: rename any old `VLLM_GLM5_*` (or other
  renamed) line in `.env` or `docker/container.env`; old names are ignored
  with a warning at startup. Delete a `SPEC_N` line: with DFlash2 the server
  refuses it. The [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) lists every renamed and retired
  setting.
- Native installs need Docker and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit first; see the
  [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the `.env` lines to remove.
